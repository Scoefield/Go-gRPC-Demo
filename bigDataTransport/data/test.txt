Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.
An old man saw my problem. Then he came close to me and helped me to check my bike. With his help, my bike was fixed and I can ride it home.
I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.
My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.
Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.

Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.
An old man saw my problem. Then he came close to me and helped me to check my bike. With his help, my bike was fixed and I can ride it home.
I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.
My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.
Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.
An old man saw my problem. Then he came close to me and helped me to check my bike. With his help, my bike was fixed and I can ride it home.
I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.

Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.
An old man saw my problem. Then he came close to me and helped me to check my bike. With his help, my bike was fixed and I can ride it home.
I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.
My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.
An old man saw my problem. Then he came close to me and helped me to check my bike. With his help, my bike was fixed and I can ride it home.
I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.
My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.
An old man saw my problem. Then he came close to me and helped me to check my bike. With his help, my bike was fixed and I can ride it home.
I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.
My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.

I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.

An old man saw my problem. Then he came close to me and helped me to check my bike. With his help, my bike was fixed and I can ride it home.
I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.
My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.
My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.
My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.
Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.

My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.
Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.
An old man saw my problem. Then he came close to me and helped me to check my bike. With his help, my bike was fixed and I can ride it home.
I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.

For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.
An old man saw my problem. Then he came close to me and helped me to check my bike. With his help, my bike was fixed and I can ride it home.
I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.
My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.

Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.
An old man saw my problem. Then he came close to me and helped me to check my bike. With his help, my bike was fixed and I can ride it home.
I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.
My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.

Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.
An old man saw my problem. Then he came close to me and helped me to check my bike. With his help, my bike was fixed and I can ride it home.
I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.
My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.

Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.
An old man saw my problem. Then he came close to me and helped me to check my bike. With his help, my bike was fixed and I can ride it home.
I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.
My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.
An old man saw my problem. Then he came close to me and helped me to check my bike. With his help, my bike was fixed and I can ride it home.
I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.
My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.
Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.

Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.
An old man saw my problem. Then he came close to me and helped me to check my bike. With his help, my bike was fixed and I can ride it home.
I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.
My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.
Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.
An old man saw my problem. Then he came close to me and helped me to check my bike. With his help, my bike was fixed and I can ride it home.
I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.

Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.
An old man saw my problem. Then he came close to me and helped me to check my bike. With his help, my bike was fixed and I can ride it home.
I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.
My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.
An old man saw my problem. Then he came close to me and helped me to check my bike. With his help, my bike was fixed and I can ride it home.
I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.
My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.
An old man saw my problem. Then he came close to me and helped me to check my bike. With his help, my bike was fixed and I can ride it home.
I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.
My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.

I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.

An old man saw my problem. Then he came close to me and helped me to check my bike. With his help, my bike was fixed and I can ride it home.
I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.
My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.
My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.
My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.
Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.

My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages.
For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.

For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.
Today, when I went home after school, my bike was broken suddenly, then I found there were no friends around.
An old man saw my problem. Then he came close to me and helped me to check my bike. With his help, my bike was fixed and I can ride it home.
I was so lucky and thankful to him. I wish him all the happiness around him all the way.

For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou.
They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners,
I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
Thirdly, Guangzhou is in the south of China. With Pearl River running across the city, Guangzhou enjoys a warm and wet climate.
While my hometown is deep in the mountains, and the weather is so changeable. Sometimes it's as cold as winter,
and sometimes it's as hot as summer in a day, which make me feel so irritated.
